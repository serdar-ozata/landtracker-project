# Note
This is not by any means a finished project. I'm not planning to finish it for now since It's not a commercial project a rather a hobby one.
# Setup
1. Fill the empty fields in config.env
1. Replace the Mapbox token in /public/javascripts/assets.js with the token of your own
1. Setup the project as any other Node JS project is set up

Use "npm run build:js" to compress and combine frontend js files for production and "npm run watch:js" for development.
